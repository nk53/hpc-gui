Future Development
==================

The following features are logical next steps:

* Enforce form validation: currently input ``pattern`` attributes are ignored, since there is nothing to "submit". However, this also means that nonsensical inputs (e.g., entering a non-numeric value for a numeric input) are unhandeled.
* The "LAMMPS arguments" option could benefit from its own custom widget. Currently, there is only a tooltip that directs the user to the LAMMPS manual.
* Benchmark examples: For each page, an example of "input settings -> output shell script" w/ optional example project download so user can see how the script is supposed to work.
* Other simulation programs: OpenMM, VASP
* Content management system (CMS) features: form editor, form builder.
